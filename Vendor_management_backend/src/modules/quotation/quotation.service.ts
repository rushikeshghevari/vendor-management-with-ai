   *  - Approval requires every approver currently on this route's roster (the CEO alone, or
   *    every active Director) to have independently approved — see `isRosterFullyApproved`.
   *    Accounts/downstream consumers must never see "approved" until that's true.

   * back to the Department User. Rejected is a hard stop: once any Director has rejected, no
   * later Approve can un-reject it.
